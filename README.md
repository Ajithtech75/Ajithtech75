## Who Am I?
Hey I am Ajith pursuing my Bachelor's of Engineering under the domain of Computer Science and Engineering.I thrive on challenges and constantly set goals for myself so I can strive forward. I am always looking for an opportunity to do better and achieve greatness. Being a Sophomore , I am still learning and therefore need an opportunity to know more about Open Source.Though I am new, I can vouch for the fact that I am a fast learner with a penchant to both learn and unlearn,(i.e) learning the latest relevant skills, business best practices and corporate etiquette, while letting go of obsolete beliefs, skills and procedures. I also bring with me some fresh ideas and hope to discuss the same with all people out here. I am confident they will find many of them to be quite useful and innovative.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything ðŸ¤£
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with other content creators
- ðŸ¥…  Goals: Contribute more to Open Source projects
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love cricket and I am a die hard fan of it.
